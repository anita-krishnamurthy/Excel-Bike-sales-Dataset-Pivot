Analysing Bike sales - Pivot Table 

# Bike Sales Data Analysis

This project utilizes a dataset of bike sales to analyze the sales distribution across different age groups and countries. The analysis is performed using Pivot Tables to summarize the data, helping us to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about bike sales, including:

- **Age Group**: The age range of the customers (e.g., <25, 25-34, >34.).
- **Country**: The country where the bike was sold.
- **Sales**: The total number of bikes sold in each transaction.


## Analysis Overview

The primary goal of this analysis is to use Pivot Tables to compare bike sales across the following dimensions:

- **Sales by Age Group**: This comparison helps to identify which age groups contribute the most to bike sales.
- **Sales by Country**: This comparison provides insights into the geographic distribution of sales and identifies which countries have the highest demand for bikes.

### Pivot Table Usage

1. **Sales by Age Group**:
   - A Pivot Table is created with **Age Group** as the rows and **Country** as the columns and **Sum of Order Quntity** as values.
   - This allows us to see how bike sales are distributed among different age groups in different countries.
